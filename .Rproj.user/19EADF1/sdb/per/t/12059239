Check for bad subjects (who are making too many errors)\n>> Badsubs.R\n# currently none\n\n# 3.

Look at MTCP scores with priming data\n>> MTCP.R\n# reverse scores items 2, 5, 8, 9, 16, and 17\n# averages across all items\n# standardizes, writes to file \"StandardizedMTCP.txt\"\n# makes scatterplots looking at relationship between MTCP and\n## Black priming effect (Black pos - Black neg (higher numbers is positive bias))\n## and White priming effect\n# See general positivity bias\n# No relationship with MTCP though\n# Did same with only \"internalizing\" scores (items 1, 3, 6, 11, 13)\n# Still no relationship\n\n# 5.
